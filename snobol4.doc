            Vanilla SNOBOL4 may be as far as your interest in SNOBOL4 goes.
          We've included a language tutorial manual on the disk so you can
          learn how to program in SNOBOL4.  We've tried to make Vanilla
          SNOBOL4 a useful entity in its own right -- something you can use
          for file reformatting jobs and quick utilities.  That's fine --
          we hope you like it and find it useful.

            But someone once said that SNOBOL4 patterns were like potato
          chips; it's hard to stop with just one.  If you find that's true,
          you'll want to know about other materials related to the SNOBOL4
          language.

            This file, SNOBOL4.DOC, contains information on SNOBOL4 books
          in print -- from beginner to advanced.  Because the richness of
          the SNOBOL4 language provides so many different ways to attack a
          problem, these books are especially useful -- every author seems
          to bring a different perspective to the language.

            We've also included descriptions of SNOBOL4+ and SPITBOL, our
          professional SNOBOL4 products.  Their many extra features allow
          you to tackle large problems, and SPITBOL runs 6 to 10 times
          faster than SNOBOL4.  All include printed manuals.

            There's also a section describing other products we manufacture
          or distribute that are useful for non-numeric applications.

            For the true SNOBOL4 addict, we've designed an outrageous,
          6-color SNOBOL4 T-shirt to proclaim that you're an iconoclast who
          knows how to solve problems quickly, easily and efficiently.
          We've priced the shirts at a very reasonable $10.95 -- less 
	  than a box of disks and far more attractive.  You might want 
	  to order two in case your spouse or best friend makes off 
	  with yours.

            Finally, if any of this whets your appetite, there's an order
          form with current prices and ordering information.

          Algorithms in SNOBOL4
          ---------------------

            James F. Gimpel.  Originally published in 1976; republished in
          1986 by Catspaw. ISBN 0-939793-00-8, paper.  ISBN 0-939793-01-6,
          hardcover.  500 pages.  A diskette with all the book's functions
          and programs is available separately.

            This is the famous "Orange Book" which provides powerful ways
          to process text and strings with SNOBOL4.  It explains how to
          process lists, convert files, format text, generate poetry, pro-
          totype a compiler, and play poker -- and that's just a start.  No
          matter what you do with SNOBOL4, you'll find functions and tech-
          niques here that will not only save you time, but amaze you with
          their ingenuity.

            Gimpel writes functions so that they can be plugged into your
          programs, which makes the diskette a valuable, and immediately
          useful, addition to your programming library.

            Chapters are: Preliminaries; Conversions; Basic String Func-
          tions; Basic List Processing; Pattern Theory; Pattern Matching
          Implementation; Pattern Construction; Input/Output; Paragraph
          Formatting; Implementation and Timing; Permutations; Sorting;
          Function Functions; Numbers; Stochastic Strings; Games; Assem-
          blers, Compilers and Macros; Solution to Odd-Numbered Exercises;
          Appendix; Index.


          SNOBOL Programming for the Humanities
          -------------------------------------

            Susan Hockey.  Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1985.  ISBN 0-19-
          824676-5, paperback.  178 pages.

            When asked what is the best introductory text for people whose
          background is in the humanities, rather than the computer sci-
          ences, we recommend this one.  Hockey begins with a simple expla-
          nation of SNOBOL4 syntax, and works through exercises with both
          text and data files, progressing to concordances, frequency
          counts, list processing, and data validation.  There are answers
          in the back.


          Computers in Linguistics
          ------------------------

            Christopher Butler.  Basil Blackwell Ltd., Oxford, 1985.  ISBN
          0-631-14267, paperback.  270 pages.

            Although the title is general, most of the book is specifically
          devoted to SNOBOL4 and its use in literary and linguistic comput-
          ing -- specialized indices, for instance, or semantic analysis.



       SNOBOL4.DOC (V1.7)              - 2 -                 November 1, 1991



            Butler provides a clear SNOBOL4 tutorial, aimed at non-program-
          mers, so that the reader "should attain a level of competence
          which will allow him to write programs for his own purposes, so
          making him much less dependent on the availability of package
          programs or under-employed professional programmers."

            There are answers to the exercises, along with a comprehensive
          bibliography, in this fine introductory text.  Note, though, that
          it presumes an environment of mainframes and terminals, rather
          than personal desktop machines.


          A SNOBOL4 Primer
          ----------------

            Ralph and Madge Griswold.  Prentice-Hall, 1973.  ISBN 0-13-
          815381-7, paperback.  192 pages.

            A beginner's introduction to SNOBOL4 for readers with no pro-
          gramming or technical background.  As a programming guide for
          humanities researchers, it predates the books by Hockey and But-
          ler by more than a decade.

            Chapters cover an introduction to computers, the basics of
          SNOBOL4, data types, pattern matching, user-defined functions,
          arrays and tables, input/output, and programming techniques.  An
          excellent chapter on debugging concludes the volume.  There are
          numerous exercises (with solutions provided) and a comprehensive
          glossary.

            Use this volume to complete your SNOBOL4 collection, or to get
          ideas for teaching SNOBOL4 to beginners.


          The Programmer's Introduction to SNOBOL
          ---------------------------------------

            W. Douglas Maurer.  Elsevier, 1976.  ISBN 0-444-00172-7, paper-
          back.  141 pages.

            This book is for people who already program in other languages,
          but want to enjoy programming by taking up SNOBOL4.  It's a slim
          book, but covers a lot of territory, with exercises and answers
          in the back.

            Chapters cover elementary SNOBOL features, pattern-matching,
          associative programming, pattern properties, advanced topics, and
          systems programming.

            You might know someone who's already competent with computers
          and proficient in one or more other languages.  Your colleague is
          always in a foul humor because he has to keep track of memory al-
          location and variable types every time he writes a program.  This
          book offers a good, and fast, way to get your colleague up and
          running with SNOBOL4, thus improving the workplace environment.

          The SNOBOL4 Programming Language, 2nd Edition
          ---------------------------------------------

            R.E. Griswold, J.F. Poage, and I.P. Polonsky.  Prentice-Hall,
          1971.  ISBN 0-13-815373-6, paperback.  256 pages.

            This is the well-known "Green Book," and it is the standard
          reference work on SNOBOL4.  Written by the creators of the lan-
          guage, this book provides its definition.

            The Green Book presumes that SNOBOL4 is running on a mainframe
          in fashion 15 years ago, and thus it is somewhat dated, with ref-
          erences to card punches and readers.

            If that's where most of your experience lies, though, you may
          be more comfortable with their approach, and their use of illus-
          trated bead diagrams to explain pattern-matching: think of the
          scanner as a needle, and the patterns as beads which may or may
          not be in line to be threaded.

            There are no practice exercises, but the authors present many
          algorithms, as well as six sample programs.


                   SNOBOL4+  --  THE PROFESSIONAL SNOBOL4 PACKAGE

            SNOBOL4+ is Catspaw's professional version of the SNOBOL4 pro-
          gramming language.  It offers many features not found in Vanilla
          SNOBOL4.  The added features make your SNOBOL4 programs even more
          concise and easy to write.  Here's a partial list:


          Additional Features
          -------------------

          ASSEMBLY-LANGUAGE INTERFACE -- Create functions to extend func-
          tionality beyond the SNOBOL4 environment.  You can write hardware
          specific functions, interfaces to other software, or perform op-
          erations that are awkward or inefficient in SNOBOL4.

          INCLUDED FILES -- Provides the inclusion of other source code
          files into a program being compiled.  Include files may be
          nested, simplifying the use of source code libraries.

          LARGE MEMORY -- Provides 300K bytes for user program and data

          ENHANCED PATTERN MATCHING -- You can "back up" during a pattern
          match with a negative argument to the LEN function, while TAB and
          RTAB allow you to position to the left of the current cursor
          position.  A MARB pattern provides a "maximum ARB" capability.

          SYMBOLIC DEBUGGER -- A SNOBOL4 program that may be included with
          the program to be debugged.  It provides tracing, breakpoints,
          variable inspection and modification, and viewing of program
          source lines.

          NO-FAIL MODE -- Diagnosis undetected statement failure

          SAVE FILE -- Write SAVE file after compilation.  This binary ob-
          ject file may be distributed with Catspaw's runtime module.

          STACK SIZE -- Adjust SNOBOL4+'s stack usage


          Additional Operators
          --------------------

          LIST SELECTION -- Provides a list of expressions that are evalu-
          ated sequentially until one succeeds; it then becomes the value
          of the list.  This provides an If-Then-Else control structure in
          convenient expression form.  For example:
             OUT = "N is " (GT(N,0) "POSITIVE", EQ(N,0) "ZERO", "NEGATIVE")

          MULTIPLE ASSIGNS -- Permits multiple assignments within a state-
          ment, as in:  RESULT = A[I = I + 1] = A[I] * 5

          PATTERN MATCH -- The binary question mark operator designates
          pattern matching.  It permits pattern matches to be used within
          an expression, for example: X = (SUB1 ? PAT1) (SUB2 ? PAT2) + 1


          Program Library
          ---------------

            SNOBOL4+ is accompanied by over 70 files of sample programs and
          functions provide examples in the areas of text processing, pars-
          ing, artificial intelligence (including ELIZA), symbolic mathe-
          matics, cryptography, and data structures.

            Reading these fascinating programs will open your eyes to the
          true expressive power of the language.


          Full Documentation
          ------------------

            Our professional package includes a 240-page printed manual
          (with index) with tutorial and thorough reference manual.  All

                       SPITBOL -- THE HIGH PERFORMANCE SNOBOL4

            With minor exceptions, SPITBOL (SPeedy ImplemenTation of
          snoBOL) is upward compatible with SNOBOL4.  The limitations are
          minor: standard system functions and operators may not be rede-
          fined with OPSYN, and Quickscan heuristics have been eliminated.
          Internally, these limitations are turned to advantage, because
          when combined with very clever system coding, the result is exe-
          cution times that must be experienced to be believed.  When run
          on the same 80386 platform, SPITBOL is typically 6 to 10 *times*
	  faster than SNOBOL4+.

            Under license from Prof. Robert B.K. Dewar, SPITBOL's creator,
          and in cooperation with Robert Goldberg (Vax and PDP-11 SPITBOL),
          Catspaw has produced versions of Macro SPITBOL for many different
          hardware platforms.


          SPITBOL-68K for the Motorola 680x0 Family
          -----------------------------------------

            SPITBOL-68K is available for 680x0 machines running the Unix
          operating system, including the Sun 2 and Sun 3, Apollo Domain,
          NCR Tower 32, Convergent S series, AT&T 7300/3B1 (Unix PC), HP
          350, WICAT, and UNISYS 5000.

            SPITBOL-68K is compatible with virtual memory.  We've scanned
          strings of 1,500,000 characters on a machine with only 1 megabyte
          of RAM (albeit somewhat slowly because of disk swapping).


          MaxSPITBOL for the Apple Macintosh
          ----------------------------------

            MaxSPITBOL integrates SPITBOL with the Macintosh windowed
          editor environment.  It runs on the Mac Plus, SE, and Mac II, or
          earlier systems that have been upgraded from the old 64K ROMS.
          400K of available RAM memory is required, but MaxSPITBOL will use
          all you provide.  It is MultiFinder friendly, and happily
          backgrounds while you perform other work.  Includes tutorial,
          reference manual, and many sample programs.  Requires System
	  level 6.01 or higher.  MaxSPITBOL is 32-bit clean and System 7
	  compatible.


          SPITBOL-386 for MS-DOS
          ----------------------

            This is a native-mode, 32-bit SPITBOL for 80386 systems under
          MS-DOS incorporating a DOS extender.  Use all the memory on your
          386 system for SPITBOL programs and data.  Have 32 megabytes of
          RAM?  Now you can use it all. Includes tutorial, reference manual,
	  and sample programs.

	    Two versions are included: One uses a DOS Extender from 
	  PharLap Software suitable for native DOS, extended or expanded 
	  memory and VCPI-compliant hosts such as DESQview 386.  The second

	  version uses a DOS Extender from Intel Corp., and works in native 
	  DOS, extended memory, and with DPMI hosts such as Windows 386 
	  Enhanced mode.  The Intel-extended version of SPITBOL is capable 
	  of producing stand-alone, royalty-free executable files, and can 
	  even run programs larger than memory, because a virtual memory 
	  manager is included.


	  SPITBOL-386 for OS/2 2.0
	  ------------------------

            This is a native-mode, 32-bit SPITBOL for 80386 systems under
          IBM's OS/2 version 2.0.  It generates stand-alone, royalty-free
	  executables, and can load DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) as 
	  external SNOBOL4 functions.
	  
	  
	  SPARC SPITBOL
	  -------------

            Our first port to a RISC architecture, SPITBOL for the
          SparcStation and Sun 4's really screams.  Our benchmarks show
          SPITBOL on a SparcStation 1 to be more than twice as fast as
          SPITBOL on a 25 Mhz 80386.  Like our other Unix products,
          SparcSPITBOL produces stand-alone, royalty-free load modules
          (a.out files).

          The Rebus Programming Language
          ------------------------------

            Rebus is a language that provides modern control structures for
          SNOBOL4 and SPITBOL.  It combines features of Icon and SNOBOL4,
          giving you some of the control structures and syntax of Icon with
          the pattern-matching power of SNOBOL4.  Rebus is actually a
          preprocessor that accepts Rebus code and outputs SNOBOL4 code,
          which in turn runs under SNOBOL4+ or SPITBOL.  With some
          restrictions, it will even run with Vanilla SNOBOL4.

            Catspaw offers an MS-DOS diskette that contains the Rebus
          preprocessor and documentation.  It is still in its experimental
          stages, so this is not a polished product.  Since Rebus produces
          SNOBOL4 code, you must have one of the SNOBOL4 or SPITBOL systems
          to use Rebus.  By way of example, here's the standard word
          frequency program in Rebus:

               function main()
                    letter := &lcase || &ucase
                    wpat := break(letter) & span(letter) . word
                    count := table()
                    while text := input do
                         while text ?- wpat do
                              count[word] +:= 1
                    if result := sort(count) then {
                         output := "Word counts"
                         I := 0
                         Repeat output := result[i +:= 1,1] || " - "
                                   || result[i,2]
                         }
                    else output := "There are no words."
               end


          Btrieve(tm) Database System Interface
          -------------------------------------

            The standard for file management on MS-DOS machines is Btrieve
          from Novell.  Btrieve has been integrated with several other
	  programming languages, and Catspaw offers an interface to SNOBOL4+.

            Our package allows you to call Btrieve functions from inside a
          SNOBOL4+ program.  Btrieve specializes in finding and updating
          database records (fixed and variable length) in a hurry with its
          tree file structure and indexing system.  You can use Btrieve to
          fetch the data you want, and SNOBOL4+ to work with it.

            Note that the interface does not include Btrieve, which must
          be purchased separately.

          Artificial Intelligence in SNOBOL4
          ----------------------------------

            SNOBOL4's backtrack searching, recursive abilities, and first-
          class data objects make it suitable for AI applications.  In
          fact, it is easy to implement LISP in SNOBOL4.

            We've taken a superb, but difficult to obtain report -- Michael
          Shafto's "Artificial Intelligence Programming in SNOBOL4" -- and
          placed it on diskette.  We've also included all of Shafto's
          demonstration programs and his SNOLISPIST function library .
          These list processing functions, written in SNOBOL4, simplify the
          task of converting LISP programs into SNOBOL4.


                            THE ICON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE


          ProIcon for the Apple Macintosh
          -------------------------------

            Icon is a high-level programming language with extensive facil-
          ities for processing strings and lists.  Icon has several novel
          features, including expressions that may produce sequences of
          results, goal-directed evaluation that automatically searches for
          a successful result, and string scanning that allows operations
          on strings to be formulated at a high conceptual level.

            Icon emphasizes a design philosophy that allows ease of pro-
          gramming and short, concise programs.  Storage allocation and
          garbage collection are automatic, and there are few restrictions
          on the sizes of objects.  Strings, lists, sets, and other struc-
          tures are created during program execution and their size does
          not need to be known when a program is written.  Values are con-
          verted to expected types automatically; for example, numeral
          strings read in as input can be used in numerical computations
          without explicit conversion.

            Examples of the kinds of problems for which Icon is well suited
          are: text analysis, editing, and formatting, document prepara-
          tion, symbolic mathematics, text generation, parsing and transla-
          tion, data laundry, graph manipulation, expert systems, artifi-
          cial intelligence applications, and rapid prototyping.

            ProIcon, an enhanced implementation of Icon for the Apple
          Macintosh, was developed jointly by Catspaw, Inc. and the Bright
          Forest Company.

          PRICES

            Publishers regularly raise the price of the books we stock,
          typically 5-10% every 6 months.  We try to hold the line on items
          we produce.  So the usual caveat applies:  Prices subject to
          change without notice.  Prices on this price list are guaranteed
	  through December 31, 1991 only.  If ordering after this date,
	  please contact Catspaw for current price information.

          PAYMENT

            Payment may be by check, money order, MasterCharge, Visa or
          American Express credit cards.  Checks and money orders MUST be
          in U.S. funds drawn on a U.S. bank; neither we nor any nearby
          financial institutions are equipped to process international
          currency transactions (checks MUST have US Federal Reserve coding
          numbers--in the past it has cost us $25-$40 to cash a check
          lacking these numbers, and we no longer can do that).  Non-U.S.
          customers will find credit cards or international postal money
	  orders to be the simplest method of transferring funds.
