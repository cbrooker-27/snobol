This program is provided AS IS without any support or warranty, expressed or

Vanilla SNOBOL4 was released because we believe many people would enjoy
programming in SNOBOL4, if there was a version of the language that was widely
and freely available.  Contributions are NOT requested or solicited.  Enjoy
and share it!

If you become a SNOBOL4 fan, you'll want SNOBOL4+, our $125 professional
version.  It allows programs and data up to 300K, assembly-language functions,
real numbers, and has dozens of extensions like: binary and random-access I/O,
include files, built-in Shell sort, SPITBOL operators, SAVE files and royalty-
free runtime, dozens of new functions and keywords and a symbolic debugger.
SNOBOL4+ includes a 240-page printed and indexed manual, and over 70 files
of sample programs and functions.

Also available is SPITBOL, a high-performance 32-bit implementation of the
SNOBOL4 language with execution speeds 6 to 10 times FASTER than SNOBOL4+.
Versions are available for MS-DOS 80386/486, OS/2 2.0, Apple Macintosh,
Sun 4/SPARC, and many 680x0 UNIX workstations.

We also carry all SNOBOL4 books in print, from beginner to advanced.

Enjoy this taste of SNOBOL4, the standard for text manipulation, pattern-
matching, and fun programming.  We hope you develop an appetite.
