HISTORY:

This program was originally written, tested, and debugged (well, as much as it 
is in its current state) in under two hours.

An associate had given me a diskette containing a manuscript which he wanted to
edit and prepare for transmission to his publisher.  The file was in "print
image" format... nicely formatted, with margins, extra word spaces due to
justification, and other conventions which are fine if the file is going to a
line printer.  This file was going to a commercial typesetter, where the
composition people wanted to see a plain ASCII file with no extra spaces,
"standard" typesetting generic coding, and no surprises.

I didn't feel like manually editing the file, and was tired of writing special
programs for each relatively simple conversion which came along.  So I wrote
GENTRAN, which is essentially a global search and replace utility, but which
also contains some of the pattern matching capabilities of SNOBOL4.

The program worked, and I eventually ported it to VAX SPITBOL where it is used
in a commercial printing environment.  That version contains some extra
niceties, is more thoroughly debugged, and runs (as SPITBOL is wont to do)
like the proverbial bat.

The original GENTRAN disappeared into the bowels of my hard disk, to resurface
again when I promised Mark Emmer of Catspaw that I'd stick some useful SNOBOL4
software in the files section of Catspaw's Bulletin Board.

So, here it is, in its original, pristine, unstructured, and somewhat
contorted form.  In a way, this program represents both the best and the worst
of SNOBOL.

I hope it provides a starting point from which you can develop your own
utilities.  The program shows some of SNOBOL's fancy tricks, like user defined
functions, tables, etc.  It also contains non-meaningful labels,
perverted program flow, and other abominations.  In short, it's a
good example of why programmers both love and hate the language.






****************************************************************************

GENTRAN is intended for use in text processing applications, specifically
in preparing files for input into some type of typesetting or composition
system which uses mnemonic coding (such as Datalogics' PAGER).  GENTRAN
does global search and replace, line trimming, quote processing, and supports
some basic pattern matching.


1. INSTALLATION

SNOBOL4 users should enter SNOBOL4 GENTRAN at the DOS prompt.

2. INPUT/OUTPUT

There are three file names which must be specified after running GENTRAN. The
first is the name of the translation table input (.TTI) file.

The .TTI file contains directives (special commands which affect the entire
translation) as well as search and replace strings.

.TTI is the default extension name for these files.  It is not necessary
to enter the .TTI extension.  If the translation table file ends in any other
extension, however, the full file spec must be given.  A translation table
input file named TEST.TTI could be specified merely as "TEST". One named
"TEST.TRA" would have to be entered as "TEST.TRA".

You can also enter directives and search/replace strings interactively.  When
prompted by the program for the .TTI filename, press ENTER.  You can now enter
commands from the keyboard.  Press Control-Z, then ENTER, when you have
completed entering commands. 

The input file is the name of the source, or "raw" file.  The output file is
where the result of the translation will be placed.  You can use the console
keyboard (CON:) for both input and output, if you wish.  This is handy for
debugging purposes when setting up a new .TTI file.

3. DIRECTIVES

Directives are GENTRAN commands which change the behavior of the software
during translations.

Directives can appear anywhere in the .TTI file.  Each directive must appear on
a line by itself, with no other text on the line.  With one exception, all
directives begin with a percent sign (%) followed by a word.  There is no
space between the percent sign and the word. GENTRAN ignores blank lines in
the .TTI file.

The exception is the comment directive, the exclamation mark (!).  Lines
containing an exlamation mark in the first position of the line are not
processed.  This is useful for entering comments in the file.






The other directives are:

IMMEDIATE DIRECTIVES:

(These directives are executed on all lines of the file, prior to search and
replace and %QUOTE operations.)

%TRIM           -- Trims trailing spaces from all lines (the default).

%LTRIM          -- Trims leading spaces and tabs from all lines.

%ATRIM          -- Trims both leading and trailing spaces from all lines.
                   The same as entering:
                   %TRIM
                   %LTRIM
                   in the .TTI file.

%COMPRESS       -- Compresses multiple spaces and tabs from all lines.

%COLLAPSE       -- Trims leading and trailing spaces and compresses multiple
                   spaces and tabs from all lines.
                   The same as entering:
                   %TRIM                                %ATRIM
                   %LTRIM               or              %COMPRESS
                   %COMPRESS

%TRACE          -- Displays the result of the translation to the terminal,
                   in addition to writing the translation to the output
                   file.


DEFERRED DIRECTIVE

This directive is executed following the immediate directives but before
the search and replace strings:

%QUOTE          -- Changes the double quote (") to open and close quotes.

Once "turned on", directives cannot be "turned off."

4.  SEARCH AND REPLACE STRINGS.

After executing all directives, GENTRAN executes each search and replace
statement in the .TTI file.

GENTRAN is case sensitive.  "THIS" will not match "This" or "this".

Strings are delimited by the backslash character (\).  Use quotes to enclose
strings within the delimiters.

If the search string contains quotes, use apostrophes to define strings:

\'"HELLO"'\ \"hello"\ (changes case and strips quotes)






\'"Marys' "'"\  \'"Mary' "'" 's"\  Translates "Marys'" to "Mary's"
Note GENTRAN ignores spaces between quoted strings.

\\ (null string) can be used to translate the search string to null.
For example:

\"green"\ \\

will effectively strip all occurrences of the string "green" in the input
file.

The null string \\ cannot be used as a search string; an error will result.

GENTRAN will not permit you to translate a string to itself.  The following
will generate an error:

\"string"\ \"string"\

You can still get into an endless loop, though, by inopportune replacements,
such as:

\"."\ \".."\

This will replace a single period with two periods. Since GENTRAN will
always find a single period, it will loop through this search and replace
line until you run out of memory or reach an internal SNOBOL limit.

Be careful when entering search and replace strings.  Remember that GENTRAN
goes through the strings one at a time, and that subsequent replacements
can be affected by what occurred previously.  In the examples above showing
how to search and replace quotes, bear in mind that if the %QUOTE directive
had been specified, the replacement would have failed.

That is, if %QUOTE were NOT enabled,
\'"Marys' "'"\  \'"Mary' "'" 's"\ 

would be successful.  If %QUOTE had been enabled, the strings would have
to be:

\"``Marys'''"\ \"``Mary's''"\

6. PATTERNS

GENTRAN recognizes legal SNOBOL function calls in the search & replace
strings.  This vastly increases GENTRAN's power and flexibility.

For example:

\POS(0) "A"\ \DUPL(".",10)\

will replace a capital A in the first position of the line to a string of
10 periods.






You can create temporary variables to rearrange data in the replacement.

\("Mr. " | "Mrs. " | "Miss ") . TITLE BREAK(" ") . NAME)\*(NAME ", " TITLE)\

will replace strings like "Mrs. Jones " with "Jones, Mrs. ".

The search string is compiled by GENTRAN when the TTI file is first read.
If the replacement string is a simple string (or concatenation of strings),
it too is statically compiled when the TTI file is read.  The example above
shows another case:  The replacement expression uses variables assigned during
the pattern match.  These variables cannot be evaluated when the TTI file
is read; they must be evaluated as each record of the input file is processed
(if the search string is found in that record).  The user expresses this
fact by placing the replacement expression in parenthesis, and preceeding it
with SNOBOL4's "defered evaluation operator", the "*".

(Hint:  If you try to use variables and functions in the replacement string,
and omit the "*", you'll likely see the word "PATTERN" in your output.)

Extreme care must taken when using SNOBOL functions to avoid endless looping
or conflicts with reserved function or variable names.
